Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool allows users to get accurate weather data for any location in the world, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

The repository includes a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that provide the foundation for the weather app tool.
